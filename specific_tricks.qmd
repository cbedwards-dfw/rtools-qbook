# Individual useful tricks

- `zoo::na.locf(super)` is useful for handling super-headers in excel; for any NA, it fills in with the most recent non-NA. E.g., `zoo::na.locf("Aggregate", NA, NA, NA, "Stillaguamish", NA, NA, NA, "Snohomish", NA, NA, NA, "TOTAL")`
- `seq_along()` is great for making iterators of a vector I need.
- `tibble::row_id_to_column()` is a great way to add unique identifier #s to rows of a tibble or dataframe.
- `clipr`!
- `dput` for turning R object into code to generate that object
- for toggleable optional quarto sections, see https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html#matching-against-metadata

- `readr::read_delim(reard::clipboard())` reads in a selected chunk of excel as a tibble.


## Case matching with functions for supereasy categorization

```{r}
#Ty: i just figured out you can put a functiong in case_match.
#Easy timestep mapping:
   group_by(ts = case_match(lubridate::month(date),

                           1:4 ~ 1,

                           5:6 ~ 2,

                           7:9 ~ 3,

                           10:12 ~ 4

                           ))
```
